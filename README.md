## Timeline
### November 2025
- 27th: Unpublished and removed the previous gdlee.today website, which had awful codebase that I wrote 5 months ago.
- 28th: *Stole* the codebase from my company's introductory website (which is also built and maintained by me) and smashed it here. Started adding my taste to the design.
### December 2025
- 1st: Finalized the design. Started adding my own contents.
### Near Future
- February 2026: Will add translations for English. (The codebase and this README are already in English, but the website itself is only in Korean for now.)
- March 2026: Will check and improve accessibility of the website.
- July 2026: Will launch the website officially.
### Far Future
- Will add web games and demo web apps that I made.
- Will add translations for Japanese.
